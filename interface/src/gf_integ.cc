    Here is a list of some integration methods defined in GetFEM (see the
    description of finite element and integration methods for a complete
    reference):

     - IM_EXACT_SIMPLEX(n) :
       Exact integration on simplices (works only with linear geometric
       transformations and PK @tfem's).
     - IM_PRODUCT(A,B) :
       Product of two integration methods.
     - IM_EXACT_PARALLELEPIPED(n) :
       Exact integration on parallelepipeds.
     - IM_EXACT_PRISM(n) :
       Exact integration on prisms.
     - IM_GAUSS1D(k) :
       Gauss method on the segment, order `k=1,3,...,99`.
     - IM_NC(n,k) :
       Newton-Cotes approximative integration on simplexes, order `k`.
     - IM_NC_PARALLELEPIPED(n,k) :
       Product of Newton-Cotes integration on parallelepipeds.
     - IM_NC_PRISM(n,k) :
       Product of Newton-Cotes integration on prisms.
     - IM_GAUSS_PARALLELEPIPED(n,k) :
       Product of Gauss1D integration on parallelepipeds.
     - IM_TRIANGLE(k) :
       Gauss methods on triangles `k=1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,13,17,19`.
     - IM_QUAD(k) :
       Gauss methods on quadrilaterons `k=2,3,5, ...,17`. Note that
       IM_GAUSS_PARALLELEPIPED should be prefered for QK @tfem's.
     - IM_TETRAHEDRON(k) :
       Gauss methods on tetrahedrons `k=1,2,3,5,6 or 8`.
     - IM_SIMPLEX4D(3) :
       Gauss method on a 4-dimensional simplex.
     - IM_STRUCTURED_COMPOSITE(im,k) :
       Composite method on a grid with `k` divisions.
     - IM_HCT_COMPOSITE(im) :
       Composite integration suited to the HCT composite finite element.

    Example:

     - I = INTEG:INIT('IM_PRODUCT(IM_GAUSS1D(5),IM_GAUSS1D(5))')

    is the same as:

     - I = INTEG:INIT('IM_GAUSS_PARALLELEPIPED(2,5)')

    Note that 'exact integration' should be avoided in general, since they
    only apply to linear geometric transformations, are quite slow, and
    subject to numerical stability problems for high degree @tfem's. @*/
