   The level-set object is represented by a primary level-set and optionally
   a secondary level-set used to represent fractures (if p(x) is the primary
   level-set function and s(x) is the secondary level-set, the crack is
   defined by :math:`p(x)=0` and :math:`s(x)\leq0` : the role of the secondary is to determine
   the crack front/tip).

   note:

      All tools listed below need the package qhull installed on your
      system. This package is widely available. It computes convex hull and
      delaunay triangulations in arbitrary dimension.
